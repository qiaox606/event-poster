    <p>In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic rages across the world. As a poetic response to such a great challenge, an “emergent gathering” has been arranged in the name of flower and art. Twenty-five contemporary artists around the world attend the exhibition with over 150 flower-themed artworks – there are some newly accomplished works that have not been released yet, and also some masterpieces that are definitely worth seeing. </p>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:transparent;">
    <p>The elements, images, and characteristics of flowers have been presented in unprecedentedly rich ways: they can be concrete, abstract, real, static, dynamic, growing, watchable, touchable, and smellable… The installations of real flowers, the familiar painting-related expressions, and the experimental forms of art have all been properly arranged in a scattered manner. When stepping into the exhibition hall, the audience become an organic part of the artworks immediately and the exhibition as well.</p>

    <p>Under the same theme of flower, these contemporary artists have created a rich array of multi-element artworks, which are completely different but closely related to each other. Through this exhibition, the museum wishes to explore new ways and new expressions of artistic languages, to provoke new thinking on the human-nature, interpersonal, and self-relationships, and to propose constructive solutions.</p>

    <p> Ms. Li Dandan, the director and curator of Pearl Art Museum, said that, “We selected over 150 artworks in total. These artworks constitute a significant part of the art history, and showcase the natural beauty and splendid customs of different places around the world. ‘In the name of flower’, these artists observe, reproduce, create, and meditate. In a poetic manner, they ponder on issues that have confronted human beings from the beginning of time and become the most urgent now, such as art, life, death, lusts, nature, emotions, and future.”</p>
